Assignment: Introduction to Pandas and Scikit-learn
Overview
This assignment focuses on using Pandas for data manipulation and exploratory data analysis, followed by building and evaluating a logistic regression model with scikit-learn. The dataset used is the 1994 U.S. Census Income dataset, which contains demographic and employment information aimed at predicting whether an individual’s income exceeds $50K annually.

Contents
Part 1: Data loading and preprocessing
Part 2: Exploratory data analysis and visualizations
Part 3: Advanced Pandas operations involving groupings and aggregations
Part 4: Implementing and evaluating logistic regression using scikit-learn
Setup Instructions
Load the adult.csv dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Run all code cells in order to avoid dependency errors.
Execute the training and evaluation pipeline to obtain the logistic regression model performance.
Visualize and interpret your exploratory data analysis plots.
Libraries Used
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
Use of Generative AI
This assignment was completed with guidance and code suggestions provided by a generative AI assistant (OpenAI’s ChatGPT). The AI was used to:

Generate function templates and full function implementations
Help debug errors and interpret warning messages
Provide explanations and best practices for pandas and scikit-learn tasks
All submitted code was reviewed and adapted by the student to ensure thorough understanding and correctness.

Notes
The model and analyses presented serve as a foundational introduction; further enhancements (e.g., hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering) may be explored independently.
Minor warnings related to pandas compatibility and data type casting may appear but do not affect the functionality or results.
Random seed (random_state=42) is used to guarantee reproducibility.
